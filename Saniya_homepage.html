		<br/>
		<br/>
		A new insight and a glimpse into my future goal reflect that along with my technical expertise, I need to augment my managerial abilities. I realize that a better merge of my technical and business skills requires a comprehensive study and research. My interests lie in subjects like User Experience Design, Project Management and System Analysis and Design.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<span class="header">Professional Goals</span>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Post Masters, my short-term goal would be to implement the various technologies adapted during the MS in Information Systems onto a real-world platform. So, I see myself working as a Business/System Analyst with a reputed global conglomerate. In the long run, my academic and professional achievements would most definitely place me in a decision-making position where my leadership skills will be tried and tested.
